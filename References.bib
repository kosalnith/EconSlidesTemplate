Using Irish micro data over the period 1997-2010, we estimate the Q model of investment and test for financing constraints using a measure of internal finance dependence. Our econometric method controls for censoring, heterogeneity and endogeneity. We find that financing constraints are binding and the impact of constraints becomes much more acute following the financial crisis. Constraints are found to be well above pre-crisis levels and especially elevated in 2007, 2008 and 2009.

Using a panel dataset from Ireland over the period 2005-2010, we test whether the CAP decoupled subsidy payments reduce credit constraints by altering the risk profile of farm earnings. We test for financing constraints in a neoclassical Q model using investment-cash flow sensitivities. Our econometric methodology controls for censoring, heterogeneity and endogeneity. We find that decoupled subsidies do reduce credit constraints. The effect is greater for farms that face higher constraints: dairy farmers and younger farms. This evidence suggests that, over and above the effect on production indicated in previous research, decoupling affects farm investment through financial channels.},

abstract = {Available data suggest that agricultural credit has been rising in recent years as a share of both the value of inputs and the value of output. There are wide regional disparities in the disbursement of agricultural credit by scheduled commercial banks. At the same time the share of agricultural GDP in total GDP is falling. In this context, this paper examines the role of direct and indirect agriculture credit in the agriculture production taking care of the regional disparities in agriculture, credit disbursement and agriculture production in an econometric framework using Dynamic Panel Data Analysis with Instrumental Variables using Arellano-Bond Regression. The analysis suggests that the direct agriculture credit amount has a positive and statistically signifi cant impact on agriculture output and its effect is immediate. The number of accounts of the indirect agriculture credit also has a positive signifi cant impact on agriculture output, but with a year lag. These results reveal that even though there are several gaps in the present institutional credit delivery system like inadequate provision of credit to small and marginal farmers, paucity of medium and long-term lending and limited deposit mobilisation and heavy dependence on borrowed funds by major agricultural credit purveyors, agriculture credit is still playing a critical role in supporting agriculture production in India.},

However, the efforts to push grain production everywhere have resulted in not only deterioration of the environment but also stagnation or even reduction in farmers' income as production costs continue to increase. This situation might be worsening after China's accession to the WTO that provides market access for bulk commodity imports. A sustainable development in Chinese agriculture depends on diversification, or structural adjustment, that allows Chinese farmers to fully utilize their comparative advantage in production of labor-intensive goods. Past experience has shown that diversification has contributed more than a half of the growth in Chinese agriculture during the reform period and reduced stresses on the environment at the same time. It is likely to contribute even more to Chinese agriculture in the future and in a sustainable manner. {\textcopyright} 2004 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {Crop diversification is one strategy that smallholder farmers may employ to reduce their vulnerability in the face of global environmental change. Diversification not only expands the number of potential crop types for market, it also improves agroecosystem functioning by building redundancy into the agricultural system and allowing for innovation in areas exhibiting impacts of climate variability. While the driving forces behind and impacts of crop diversification have been extensively investigated, there are particular issues for the prospects of crop diversification to reduce household vulnerability within semi-arid agricultural systems. The decision to diversify crops is a particularly challenging one for farmers in semi-arid systems. Semi-arid systems can exhibit greater variability in annual precipitation in areas that are marginal for agricultural production. Changes to the timing of the growing season (onset of rains) and mid-season dry periods in particular pose significant challenges to farmers in semi-arid ecosystems. This paper examines the spatial diversification of crop types across an upland-lowland gradient on Mount Kenya's northwestern slopes. We perform regression analyses using household-level survey data collected during the summer of 2012 to investigate the factors contributing to varying levels of crop diversification and implications for crop production in a semi-arid irrigated agricultural system. We hypothesize that the study area locations at higher elevations will be able to grow a greater variety of crops due to climate suitability. Our analysis demonstrates that household-level income, field size, exposure to agricultural extension officers, and suitability of environmental conditions are related to the likelihood of smallholder crop diversification. More favorable growing conditions appear to outweigh limitations posed by inaccessibility and financial constraints, which has implications for adaptation to climate change in semi-arid ecosystems. We discuss the results in the context of challenges posed by global environmental change.},

abstract = {Purpose: This article investigates the mechanism of the direct and indirect effects of epidemics on agricultural production and projects the impact of COVID-19 on agricultural output in China. Design/methodology/approach: This article first adopts a dynamic panel model and spatial Durbin model to estimate the direct and indirect effects, followed by a growth accounting method to identify the channels by which epidemics affect agriculture; finally, it projects the overall impact of COVID-19 on agriculture. Findings: The incidence rate of epidemics in a province has a negative impact on that province's own agricultural productivity, but the increase in the input factors (land, fertilizer and machinery) can make up for the loss and thus lead to insignificant direct effects. However, this “input-offset-productivity” mechanism fails to radiate to the surrounding provinces and therefore leads to significant indirect/spillover effects. It is projected that COVID-19 will lower China's agricultural growth rate by 0.4{\%}–2.0{\%} in 2020 under different scenarios. Research limitations/implications: It is crucial to establish a timely disclosure and sharing system of epidemic information across provinces, improve the support and resilience of agricultural production in the short run and accelerate the process of agricultural modernization in the long run. Originality/value: Considering the infectivity of epidemics, this article evaluates the mechanism of the direct and indirect effects by introducing a spatial dynamic model into the growth accounting framework. Moreover, besides the impact on input portfolio and productivity, this article also investigates whether epidemics reshape agricultural production processes due to panic effects and control measures.},

abstract = {In the described research three agricultural commodities (i.e., wheat, corn and soybean) spot prices were analyzed. In particular, one-month ahead forecasts were built with techniques like dynamic model averaging (DMA), the median probability model and Bayesian model averaging. The common features of these methods are time-varying parameters approach toward estimation of regression coefficients and dealing with model uncertainty. In other words, starting with multiple potentially important explanatory variables, various component linear regression models can be constructed. Then, from these models an averaged forecast can be constructed. Moreover, the mentioned techniques can be easily modified from model averaging into a model selection approach. Considering as benchmark models, time-varying parameters regression with all considered potential price drivers, historical average, ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average) and the na{\"{i}}ve forecast models, the Diebold-Mariano test suggested that DMA is an interesting alternative model, if forecast accuracy is the aim. Secondly, the interpretation of time-varying weights ascribed to component models containing a given variable suggested that economic development of emerging BRIC economies (Brazil, Russia, India and China) is recently one of the most important drivers of agricultural commodities prices. The analysis was made on the monthly data between 1976 and 2016. The initial price drivers were various fundamental, macroeconomic and financial factors.},

abstract = {The U.S. has a long history of providing generous support for the agricultural sector. A recent omnibus package of farm legislation, the 2008 Farm Bill (P.L. 110-246) will provide in excess of {\$}284 billion in financial support to U.S. agriculture over the 2008-2012 period. Commodity program payments account for {\$}43.3 billion of this total. Our paper is concerned with the distribution of these benefits. Farm subsidies make agricultural production more profitable by increasing and stabilizing farm prices and incomes. If these benefits are expected to persist, farm land values should capture the subsidy benefits. We use a large sample of individual farm land values to investigate the extent of this capitalization of benefits. Our results confirm that subsidies have a very significant impact on farm land values and thus suggest that landowners are the real benefactors of farm programs. As land is exchanged, new owners will pay prices that reflect these benefits, leaving the benefits of farm programs in the hands of former owners that may be exiting production. Approximately 45{\%} of U.S. farmland is operated by someone other than the owner. We report evidence that owners benefit not only from capital gains but also from lease rates which incorporate a significant portion of agricultural payments even if the farm legislation mandates that benefits must be allocated to producers. Finally, we examine rental agreements for farmers that rent land on both a cash and share basis. We find evidence that farm programs that are meant to stabilize farm prices provide a valuable insurance benefit.},

abstract = {Malnourishment continues to remain a challenge in developing countries. As the undernourished are largely smallholder farmers, it is widely assumed that farm diversification and mixed crop-livestock agricultural systems can help alleviate this problem. However, empirical evidence in this context is limited. Hence, we use a two-year panel's data from Laos to examine whether farm production diversity as well as a mixed crop-livestock farming system improves household dietary diversity among smallholder farmer. The results from the fixed effects regression indicate that although farm production diversity does lead to a higher dietary diversity, the effect diminishes with continued farm diversification. The counterfactual analysis from the endogenous switching regression reveals that mixed crop-livestock farming systems do not necessarily enhance dietary diversity. However, we further find that purchasing food from the markets plays an important role in enhancing the dietary diversity of rural smallholder farmers.},

abstract = {Forecasting of any issues, events or variables requires an in-depth understanding of the underlying factors affecting it. Such is the case for forecasting annual productivity of agricultural crops. Agricultural productivity, in the context of India, extensively depends upon numerous factors namely: good rainfall, timely use of appropriate fertilizer and pesticides, favorable climate and environments, agricultural subsidies given to farmers etc. Therefore, forecasting productivity of agricultural crops is not only tedious but also indispensible, as large chunk of people depends on agriculture for their livelihood. Various uni-variate and multi-variate time series techniques can be applied for forecasting such variables. In this paper, ARIMA model has been applied to forecast annual productivity of selected agricultural product. For empirical analysis a set of 34 different products has been considered, contingent upon availability of required data. Applying annual data from 1950 to 2010, forecasted values has been obtained for another 5 years since 2011. The validity of the model is verified with various model selection criteria such as Adj R2, minimum of AIC and lowest MAPE values. Among the selected crops, tea provides the lowest MAPE values, whereas cardamom provides lowest AIC values.},

Results revealed that all countries sustained agricultural productivity growth at variable rates with Bangladesh experiencing highest rate estimated @1.05{\%} p.a. followed by India (0.52{\%}), Pakistan (0.38{\%}) and Nepal (0.06{\%} p.a.). There were little or no variation in technical and scale efficiency changes among the countries. However, residual scale efficiency increased @0.44{\%} p.a. in Bangladesh, 0.12{\%} p.a. in Pakistan, remained unchanged in India and declined -0.39{\%} p.a. in Nepal. Similarly, mix efficiency increased @0.44{\%} in Bangladesh, remained unchanged in India and declined @-0.12{\%} p.a.in Pakistan and -0.39{\%} p.a. in Nepal. The major drivers of agricultural TFP growth were the levels of natural, human and technology capital endowments whereas financial capital and crop diversification had opposite effects. Policy implications include land and tenurial reforms aimed at consolidating farm operation size and smooth operation of the land rental market to improve natural capital, investments in education to improve human capital and agricultural R{\&}D to enhance technology capital in order to boost agricultural productivity growth in South Asia.},

Estimates for the model are provided across a range of nonspatial and spatial estimators, including spatial error and spatial lag models with fixed and random effects extensions. Given the importance of location and extensive use of panel data in many subfields of agricultural economics, these recently developed spatial panel methods hold great potential for applied researchers.},

abstract = {The promise of digitalization is enormous and nowhere is it more critical than in its potential to transform food supply chain. Consumers have become more educated and are demanding real-time updated information on foods they consumed through digital media. They are also increasingly demanding to know if the foods they consume are environmentally and socially sustainable or not. As a result, food product traceability, safety, and sustainability issues have become crucial concerns to food retailers, distributors, processors, and farmers. Digitalization allows food supply chains to be highly connected, efficient, and responsive to customer needs and regulation requirements. However, digitalizing a traditional food supply chain is challenging and resource demanding. This is more so for developing countries where moving food from farms to consumers can take months as it travels through an array of middlemen. Unfortunately, little is available in the existing literature on food supply chain digitalization. So far, current researchers mainly explore the benefits of digitalization. Using cases in three companies, this paper explores the practices, challenges, and opportunities faced by Thailand food manufacturers in digitalizing their food supply chains. A framework for food supply chain digitalization is proposed and its implications for research and practices are discussed.},

abstract = {Income and crop diversification have been identified as essential strategies for raising income and reducing rural poverty. Both strategies were analyzed based on empirical data collected from rural households. The analysis was done using the Simpson Index of Diversity (SID) and Ordinary least square (OLS) regression analysis. The results revealed that diversification into a number of income sources and crops grown were very high. The determinants of income diversification were number of children less than 12 years old, number of adults above 60 years old, availability of electricity in the household and distance from local market. The determinants of crop diversification were, age and level of education of the household head, number of extension visits, availability of tractor hiring services and returns from crop production. Most households occupations in the study area were no longer agriculture based, however there willingness to diversify was significantly influenced by their socioeconomic characteristics.

abstract = {This paper investigates the impact of two environmental policies: emissions abatement subsidy and emissions tax, on a three-tier supply chain where the manufacturer distributes through competitive retailers and invests in emissions abatement manufacturing technology. The government pursues social welfare maximization, while the manufacturer and retailers are profit driven. We find that the subsidy policy offers the manufacturer greater incentives to abate pollution and yields higher profits for channel members; however, when emissions abatement is very costly and production emissions are highly damaging, the tax policy should be implemented, as the subsidy policy leads to lower social welfare and environmental performance. Interestingly, we show that the manufacturer has no incentive to improve emissions abatement efficiency if the environmental damage of its production is high under the subsidy policy or low under the tax policy. The manufacturer always welcomes more downstream entry under the subsidy policy but not necessarily under the tax policy; each retailer always fares worse with more competition. More competition enhances social welfare under the tax policy but not necessarily under the subsidy policy. Furthermore, caution should be exercised when adopting the subsidy policy, because a “hazard zone” exists where society suffers but does not under the tax policy.},

abstract = {Agricultural price policy has come under serious attack recently for recommending support prices higher than what the costs of production warrant, supposedly leading to a distortion of the market, and, therefore, to food deprivation. With an in-depth analysis of costs and returns in rice and wheat, which are the most state-protected crops and underlie the livelihoods of millions of farmers, this paper examines the effectiveness of agricultural price policy in enabling farmers to obtain sufficient profits to promote investment, technology and productivity and thereby to food security. The rising cost of production due to the overemphasis on getting input prices right is a major factor that has led to higher support prices. Another factor is the percolation of volatility in global prices through trade liberalisation. Because of this, wheat support prices had to be hiked steeply in recent years so that sufficient quantities are procured. This has distorted parity between the prices of rice and wheat.},

abstract = {In the context of decoupling resource consumption and environmental impacts from economic growth, more and more interest is devoted to comprehensive accounting of anthropogenic material flows within the economy and with the natural environment. Here, the field of PSUTs, considered as a general framework for physical data integration and environmental-economic modelling, comes to play. PSUTs estimation, including data compilation and mass balancing, generally shows two main limitations: it requires large scale and time-consuming efforts, while the uncertainty associated with the resulting tables is most often not addressed. This work presents a numerical method to estimate consistent PSUTs considering data uncertainties. It allows all relevant information to be used in the PSUTs estimation process, including potentially large-data errors depending on the data quality. The mass balancing identities (input = output), in terms of products and activities, are used in a mathematical technique which fulfills all requirements of a typical constrained optimization technique: Data reconciliation. According to the theoretical framework defined in this work [Schmidt et al., 2010], consistent PSUTs are estimated for France for the year 2006 as a case study. Such an approach calls for data reconciliation of various sources of information in estimating consistent PSUTs. It reduces the time for their estimation, considering all information in the most efficient manner possible while at the same time improving their reliability. This example suggests that the numerical method provides a promising approach for estimating consistent PSUTs considering data uncertainties.},

Long-term liabilities also move countercyclically for state banks whereas funding for non-state banks in the form of deposit and long-term liabilities is procyclical. Greater lending cyclicality is observed for both private and state banks in Cambodia, Myanmar, Laos, and Vietnam (CMLV) compared to Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Singapore (ASEAN-5). Lending of non-ASEAN based foreign banks shows greater procyclicality than that of domestic banks for the ASEAN-5 countries, although not for the CMLV countries. During the global financial crisis, lending by non-ASEAN based foreign banks contracted sharply even as lending by ASEAN based foreign banks was unaffected.

abstract = {Historically, earnings from farming in many developing countries have been depressed by a pro-urban bias in own-country policies, as well as by governments of richer countries favoring their farmers with import barriers and subsidies. Both sets of policies reduced global economic welfare and agricultural trade, and added to global inequality and poverty. Over the past three decades, much progress has been made in reducing agricultural protection in high-income countries and agricultural disincentives in developing countries. However, plenty of price distortions remain. As well, the propensity of governments to insulate their domestic food market from fluctuations in international prices has not waned. Such insulation contributes to the amplification of international food price fluctuations, yet it does little to advance national food security when food-importing and food-exporting countries equally engage in insulating behavior. Thus there is still much scope to improve global economic welfare via multilateral agreement not only to remove remaining trade distortions but also to desist from varying trade barriers when international food prices gyrate. This article summarizes indicators of trends and fluctuations in farm trade barriers before examining unilateral or multilateral trade arrangements, together with complementary domestic measures, that could lead to better global food security outcomes. {\textcopyright} 2013 International Association of Agricultural Economists.},

The Tobit regression results on loan repayment of Log-likelihood function (- 17.99385) showed that farm experience, farm location, cost of obtaining loan, visitation, borrowing frequency and education with normalized coefficients of –0.0285, -0.0661, -0.1196E-04 0.1048, 0.0518 and 0.0112 respectively were very important factors in determining the repayment performance of the beneficiaries in the institution. The study showed that the institutions considered were characterised by untimely delivery of loan owing to complicated, cumbersome and time-consuming procedures in loan processing/approval decision. The decomposition of repayment elasticities employed in this study indicated that the elasticity of value of loan repaid in good times was more than the elasticity of probability of repayment since the amount of loan size recovered has a long way to go in enhancing the lending capabilities of the institutions. The results of the study therefore provided a baseline data for policy formulation needed to facilitate accessibility of farmers to agricultural loans and enhance loan repayment performance.},

Three main results emerge. First, after controlling for bank characteristics, country and time effects, mutual banks and government-owned banks exhibit a lower profitability than privately owned banks, in spite of their lower costs. Second, public sector banks have poorer loan quality and higher insolvency risk than other types of banks while mutual banks have better loan quality and lower asset risk than both private and public sector banks. Finally, while ownership concentration does not significantly affect a bank's profitability, a higher ownership concentration is associated with better loan quality, lower asset risk and lower insolvency risk. These differences, along with differences in asset composition and funding mix, indicate a different financial intermediation model for the different ownership forms. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The regression results indicate that more income-diversified banks have lower cost efficiency while more asset-diversified banks have only lower persistent cost efficiency. More funding-diversified banks enjoy higher profit efficiency, while more asset-diversified banks enjoy only higher persistent profit efficiency. Funding-diversified banks with majority government ownership demonstrate higher cost efficiency but lower profit efficiency than other banks, while both funding and asset diversification make foreign banks less profit efficient.},

We compare the lending responses across government-owned and private banks to financial crises using the balance sheet information of 764 major banks headquartered in 50 countries over the period of 1994–2009. Using a nested panel regression framework that allows for parameter shifts in the bank lending equation, we find robust evidence that government-owned banks increase their lending during crises relative to normal times, while private banks' lending decreases. Government-owned banks thus counteract the lending slowdown of private banks. The findings suggest that governments can play an active counter-cyclical role in their banking systems directly through government-owned banks.},

abstract = {Crop diversification is one strategy that smallholder farmers may employ to reduce their vulnerability in the face of global environmental change. Diversification not only expands the number of potential crop types for market, it also improves agroecosystem functioning by building redundancy into the agricultural system and allowing for innovation in areas exhibiting impacts of climate variability. While the driving forces behind and impacts of crop diversification have been extensively investigated, there are particular issues for the prospects of crop diversification to reduce household vulnerability within semi-arid agricultural systems. The decision to diversify crops is a particularly challenging one for farmers in semi-arid systems. Semi-arid systems can exhibit greater variability in annual precipitation in areas that are marginal for agricultural production. Changes to the timing of the growing season (onset of rains) and mid-season dry periods in particular pose significant challenges to farmers in semi-arid ecosystems. This paper examines the spatial diversification of crop types across an upland-lowland gradient on Mount Kenya's northwestern slopes. We perform regression analyses using household-level survey data collected during the summer of 2012 to investigate the factors contributing to varying levels of crop diversification and implications for crop production in a semi-arid irrigated agricultural system. We hypothesize that the study area locations at higher elevations will be able to grow a greater variety of crops due to climate suitability. Our analysis demonstrates that household-level income, field size, exposure to agricultural extension officers, and suitability of environmental conditions are related to the likelihood of smallholder crop diversification. More favorable growing conditions appear to outweigh limitations posed by inaccessibility and financial constraints, which has implications for adaptation to climate change in semi-arid ecosystems. We discuss the results in the context of challenges posed by global environmental change.},

abstract = {This article describes various opportunities but also constraints to greater crop diversification, and the impact on local sustainability in the Khorezm province of Uzbekistan in the Aral Sea basin. At present, approximately 70{\%} of the area in this study region is sown to irrigated cotton and winter wheat under the so-called state mandate. We present evidence of the benefits of moving away from this approach toward more diversified farming with an increasing area of alternative crops in the selected region. We report on a series of studies that included a) crop suitability screening based on secondary data, b) joint farmer experiments, and c) a mathematical simulation model with the overarching objective to assess potential benefits and constraints for crop diversification. The findings of this long-term, multiyear, and multidisciplinary approach show that greater crop diversity can increase water use efficiency, and secure farm income in dryland areas prone to water scarcity and soil salinity. In addition, the findings of the simulation model confirmed that crop diversification could secure income of downstream farmers during the climate-driven decline in water availability. Overall, the findings indicate that greater crop diversity and improved access to markets can lead to a sustainable development path in the region. {\textcopyright} Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

The 'market-based' British Renewables Obligation (RO) is not more cost-effective compared to the German feed in tariff. Although the nominal rates of payment per kWh of renewable energy are higher in Germany, this is more than offset by lower wind speeds in Germany producing a lower return on investment compared to the UK. A harmonised, EU-wide market-based system, would not improve cost-effectiveness, and may serve to reduce, rather than increase, local investment in renewable energy. On the other hand, nationally based green electricity certificate systems like the RO are not intrinsically biased against locally owned or co-operative ventures. Systems are needed which encourage a diversity of investment in renewable energy from local as well as institutional sources. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The paper shows that state-owned banks located in developing countries have fiscal costs because they are characterized by lower returns than comparable privately owned banks (on the other hand, there is no evidence that state-owned banks located in industrial countries are less profitable than their private counterparts). We then point out that this evidence cannot be used as an argument against the existence of state-owned banks, as this low profitability might stem from state-owned banks' activity on projects characterized by low private sector investment and high social return. While we find no evidence that the presence of state-owned banks promotes economic growth or financial development, we also find that the evidence that state-owned banks lead to lower growth and financial development is not as strong as previously thought.},

After describing the institutional challenges that China faces in building a well-functioning equity market to complement its banking system, a series of cointegrated vector autoregressive models and the associated variance decompositions and impulse response functions show that banking sector development was central to these successes. At the same time, we find that stock market development, as measured by market size and trading volume, did not contribute significantly to them. We suspect that lingering questions regarding the quality of China's stock markets are largely responsible for the latter result, though it also may reflect the smaller size of the "stock market economy" relative to the broader economy in which we measure outcomes. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {We analyze the lending cyclicality of 213 ASEAN commercial banks over the period 2001–2015. The findings indicate that lending by private banks is procyclical while lending by state banks is countercyclical. Long-term liabilities also move countercyclically for state banks whereas funding for non-state banks in the form of deposit and long-term liabilities is procyclical. Greater lending cyclicality is observed for both private and state banks in Cambodia, Myanmar, Laos, and Vietnam (CMLV) compared to Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Singapore (ASEAN-5). Lending of non-ASEAN based foreign banks shows greater procyclicality than that of domestic banks for the ASEAN-5 countries, although not for the CMLV countries. During the global financial crisis, lending by non-ASEAN based foreign banks contracted sharply even as lending by ASEAN based foreign banks was unaffected. Overall, our results confirm that bank ownership influences lending and funding sensitivity to economic fluctuations.},

This is particularly important for capital-intensive industries such as food processing, which lack short-run flexibility due to adjustment costs. This study considers the impact of capital and quasi-fixity on capital and noncapital input decisions made in the U.S. food and kindred products industry from 1965 to 1991. A cost-based production theory model is used to evaluate investment motivations for three capital components. Productivity growth accompanying changing input patterns is then discussed, focusing on capital and farm input demand.},

abstract = {Microfinance is commonly known as banking upside down because micro-lending institutions make very small loans available to businesspeople excluded from conventional banks. Microfinance has piqued the interest of political elites in many Global South countries because of its support by the poor masses. The case of the Trinidadian microfinance sector shows that the state dominates the micro-lending sector through its agency, the National Entrepreneurship Development Company (NEDCO). The main argument for this paper is that government-owned microfinance is in fact “political microfinance” because of its exclusionary tendency of the small businesspeople in the slums of east Port of Spain. On the ground, the current party politics have fuelled the perception that persons of African descent are the most excluded from accessing a small loan. However, this paper finds that no matter which party is in power, the state has co-opted NEDCO to make loans available to its own party supporters, and this practice goes against the microfinance sector's goal of inclusive finance.},

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to investigate the factors that hinder the growth and survival of SMEs in Jordan. The methodology adopted in this research is critical literature reviews, quantitative data collection through questionnaires to 241 SMEs 'owners and managers located in selected cities in Jordan. The results of the study reveal that the most common constraints hindering SMEs growth and survival in Jordan are: lack of financial support; competition barriers; lack of qualified human resources; and rigid business rules and regulations. Most SMEs agreed that government should develop program that is strongly required as a strategic move to emerge the economy and dedicate more efforts to eliminate SMEs barriers, like encourage the financial institutes and banks to provide suitable credit facilities to this sector. Legal infrastructure such as privacy law, e-signature and knowledge acquisition law, facilitate SME with technology through soft loan to buy supporting technology for their business, and many supporting program needed by SMEs. The significance of this study stems from the fact that very few studies have explored the issue of factors constraining the growth and survival of SMEs in Jordan. Also, it offers guidance for future research in a field of research that is still in its infancy.},

@article{Tong2011,
abstract = {This paper attempts to define the factors which determine emigration and rice doublecropping, i.e. rice cultivation on the same plot twice per year, by rural households in Cambodia, and investigates whether these decisions influence each other using data from a two-period panel survey of 231 households in three provinces in rural Cambodia. In the analysis, we take into account possible correlation between these decisions (through estimating a seemingly unrelated bivariate probit model) and unobserved heterogeneity among farmers (through estimating a random-effects probit model). It is found that rice double-cropping and emigration decisions are not closely inter-related. We can also conclude that the availability of water and agricultural land are the key determinants of rice double-cropping. Households which rely on animal draught power for agricultural production are unlikely to engage in rice double-cropping. Policies aimed at increasing irrigation and providing socioeconomic land concessions in rural areas may play a critical role in improving agricultural production.},

abstract = {While Botswana since independence has experienced impressive economic growth and development this progress has not been accompanied by economic diversification and endogenous growth. In this article we focus on the colonial period and investigate to what extent the formal sector of Bechuanaland Protectorate (colonial Botswana) had the potential to constitute the basis for a diversification of the dominating cattle economy away from its dependency on exporting a single natural resource good–beef. We base our study on colonial archive sources and anthropological evidence which we use to: examine labour market structures; estimate welfare ratios and surplus; and discuss government spending. We find that the demand for skilled labour and human capital development was low throughout the colonial period and that the private sector generally lacked the economic strength and dynamics to develop alternative and/or complementary sectors. Further, we find no evidence of demand driven diversification, neither stemming from private sector consumption and investments, nor from government spending on economic activities outside the cattle sector, infrastructure and human capital development.},

abstract = {Input-output (I-O) analysis has been around for nearly 70 years, and although its use has ebbed and flowed over the years, it has always retained a dedicated core of users in the worldwide research community. Recently however, there seems to have been a notable increase in the use of input-output tables in empirical analyses addressing a wide range of policy issues. This is partly due to the improved availability and quality of national input-output tables as well as modern IT capabilities allowing more complex analyses to be undertaken by more researchers. A quick glance through recent editions of the journal Economic Systems Research confirms the variety of research topics that can benefit from inputoutput analysis as does a recent user survey conducted by OECD...},

abstract = {This study investigates 92 countries of different legal origins, including 25 English origin, 44 French origin, 11 Scandinavian and German origin, and 12 socialist origin countries. Compared to other countries, China has the highest government ownership of banks, and lies in the middle in terms of official supervisory power over banks, and government efficiency in governance. As regards economic development measured by per capita GDP growth, in the period from 1995 to 2015, China performed significantly better than all the other countries in the sample–countries varying in legal origin, government ownership of banks, level of economic and financial development, supervisory power over banks, and government efficiency. The findings are robust when we examine the country-years with similar per capita GDP as that of China. The regression results show that in some circumstances, higher government ownership of banks is associated with higher economic growth and the positive association is more significant in socialist origin countries. Further discussions suggest that the high government involvement in commercial banks fits in well with the unique characteristics of China–such as a large population, underdeveloped economy, imbalance in resources and development in different areas, as well as the utmost trust placed on the Chinese government and government owned banks–thus may benefit economic growth.},

abstract = {Banking firms are becoming increasingly aware that their clients' management of environmental and social risks may in term threaten their own business as lenders and investors. In addition, stakeholders are requiring banks to improve their social performance. As a result, some banks are developing corporate social responsibility (CSR) policies and management systems to reduce potential risks and improve their performance. In the Spanish financial system, half of the banking firms are savings banks, most of which have always used some Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) criteria in their management. Private Banks have only recently started to integrate social aspects in their performance. However, no formal analysis has been carried out on the impact of CSR strategies. Various initiatives have been launched nationally and internationally to include the social dimension in management systems. The purpose of this research is to analyse the social performance of the main Spanish financial companies through public data such as social or sustainability reports and media sources. In order to do this, we need to determine which CSR criteria most greatly affect banking firms and to choose the most accurate quantitative and qualitative indicators to measure social performance. {\textcopyright} Springer 2006.},

abstract = {Greek governments have supported investments to rural areas financially either by covering part of the investment and/or offering advantages with respect to interest rate loans or tax advantages. This support had been tendered either by nationally financed programs, called Development Laws, or by other programs, mainly financed by the European Union. The financial support depended on the area where the investment took place, as well as the sector and the nature of the investment. Additionally, another program, the LEADER initiative, was developed. It was financed mainly by the European Union, in order to support investments in rural areas and promote the development and the structural adaptation of the less developed European regions. This paper examines public financial support for investments in rural areas in the case of the region of Thessaly, one of the 13 regions in Greece. Its aim is to point out the importance of investments in the sectors of tourism, industry and agriculture. The region of Thessaly presents obvious interest because of the development of these sectors at different levels, depending on local production characteristics. The time period is the 2000s, when important investments were undertaken in the region, supported financially by Development Laws and the LEADER initiative.},

This paper seeks to understand which sectors account for the aggregate TFP gap between rich and poor countries. I propose a new approach for estimating sectoral TFP using panel data on sectoral employment shares and GDP per capita. The approach builds a three-sector model of structural transformation and uses it to infer time paths of sectoral TFP consistent with the reallocation of labor between sectors and GDP per capita growth of a set of developing countries over a 40-year period. I find that relative to the US, developing countries are the least productive in agriculture, followed by services and then manufacturing. The findings are consistent with the evidence from micro data and the approach has the novelty to measure sectoral TFPs over the long term.},

Further, these persistent expansions take place just before competitive elections, and are associated with lower future employment growth by firms in other regions.

The paper also shows that, although industrial policy may pay off more easily than previously thought, Korean industrial policy fails to pay off because it distorted the price mechanism too severely and for too long.

On asking upon the comparative interests of people of the U.S. as well in such analysis, he critically analyzes the difference in time spans that each country take in producing input-output tables. U.S. government takes around seven year to produce tables while that of Japan takes only three years.

abstract = {Government subsidies are an important policy tool that can help firms develop technological learning, and this technological learning effect plays a key role in firms' research and development (R{\&}D) efficiency. Thus, this study develops a two-stage approach to illustrate the effect of subsidy policies and technological learning on R{\&}D efficiency in the information technology (IT) industry. The technological learning effect in 128 firms in the IT industry from 2008 to 2015 was measured using the learning experience curve. Subsequently, government R{\&}D subsidy intensity was considered as a categorical variable, and this estimated result was treated as an intangible input into a data envelopment analysis (DEA) structure to evaluate R{\&}D efficiency in 2015. This study makes three major contributions. First, the developed approach incorporates the effect of subsidy policies and technological learning into the DEA structure. Second, the empirical results demonstrate the appropriateness of incorporating subsidy policies and technological learning into evaluations of R{\&}D efficiency. Finally, our results identify the key sources of inefficiency as a shortfall in the number of patents and a lack of technological learning. Based on these key findings, some improved strategies were recommended to decision makers.},

abstract = {We develop indicators to measure the degree of economic integration and cooperation
among East Asian economies and compare these with similar measures for other
regions. Our indicators cover regional integration in trade, investment, financial assets,
and people-to-people exchange. We also analyze measures of regional cooperation
such as the density of free trade agreements and official policy dialogues. We find that in
various Asian groupings, and especially in a group of 16 integrating Asian economies,
interdependence in trade, direct investment, financial flows, and other forms of economic
and social exchange has increased significantly over time, and now approaches that in
the European Union. Nonetheless, Asia's official cooperation remains weak and formal
regional institutions remain relatively underdeveloped. To provide insight into the causes
of this discrepancy, we also develop quantitative measures of political and cultural
similarity of nations, and find that Asian countries have relatively low levels of political
and cultural proximity compared to regions such as Europe. The diversity of political
interests and cultural values may have hindered more intense cooperation among Asian
economies in the past. But if regional economic and social interactions continue to grow,
requirements for joint decision-making are also likely to expand, leading to stronger
frameworks of official cooperation. },

abstract = {With increasing competition in the mobile communication market in Korea, the policy of subsidising mobile handsets has become an on-going issue causing considerable controversy. This paper analyses the development of handset subsidy-related policies in Korea from 1997 to 2001. In particular, it considers the multiple regulatory schemes and feasibility of regulatory policies from the three authorities: the MIC, the KCC and the KFTC, all of which were involved with the handset subsidy policy in Korea. In April 1999, these authorities eventually abolished the obligatory subscription period that had underpinned the handset subsidy and finally banned it in June 2000. These decisions affected each of the players differently, ranging from a positive impact on the mobile communication carriers to a negative impact on the handset manufacturers. In addition, conflicting approaches by the different authorities created inconsistencies in the handset subsidy policies. This paper shows that multiple regulatory schemes designed to control handset subsidy policy without consensus increases market uncertainty. It reviews the feasibility of the ban on handset subsidies by regulatory enforcement. With consensus and agreed regulatory goals and consistent, stable and predictable policies, the regulatory costs of the handset subsidy related policy can be reduced. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Contract farming (CF) is increasingly seen as an effective mechanism to maximise the inclusion of and benefits for small-scale farmers, while giving some control over production to agribusinesses without requiring land ownership. In Cambodia, CF takes many forms and involves food and industrial crops, yet the different CF models and contract types have not been identified. Farmers and contractors have encountered many problems in obtaining reliable benefits from and sustaining CF schemes. The research objectives were to identify and evaluate the various models of CF practiced in Cambodia, explore the supports required for small farmers to maximise benefits from CF, and suggest policy options to improve linkages between small farmers and CF. Snowball sampling was used to identify different CF models and their location, and information was collected from 38 key informant interviews and seven focus group discussions. The findings revealed four modalities of CF in operation: centralised, informal, multipartite and intermediary. Most of the CF schemes are run by support agencies and contractors, with contract documents (formula and format) drawn up by contractors without recourse to the coordination mechanism described in the Sub-decree on Contract Farming. Institutional supports especially for individual contract farmers remain limited. Centralised and multipartite models can provide more benefits if contracts and agreements are well managed and coordinated and there is enough support for farmers. CF practices do exist at community level but, so far, there has been no clear supportive action from government, even though the sub-decree has been signed. The promotion of CF to improve agricultural productivity and rural incomes will not be effective unless the sub-decree is accompanied by policy, strategy and action plans. To ensure that CF schemes work well and to provide more benefits to farfarmers, government must pay attention to four strategic areas: • Linking farmer organisations and CF schemes • Formalising markets • Improving production inputs and services • Enforcing the sub-decree by implementing its role as stated in Article 7, Chapter 2, and forming the Coordination Committee for Agricultural Production Contract to (i) develop policy to support CF, (ii) strengthen harmonisation between farmers and contractors, and (iii)},

We empirically investigate the impact of government subsidies on firms' R{\&}D decisions of listed manufacturing firms in China. In contrast to prior studies, we split firms' R{\&}D decision into two elements of ‘whether to invest decision' and ‘how much to invest decision'. The influences and mechanism of government subsidies on R{\&}D decision are theoretically analysed to develop hypotheses tested in this study. We find that government subsidies have a promotion effect on both elements of the firms' R{\&}D decision. Moreover, we also demonstrate the heterogeneous effects of government subsidies between state-owned and non-state firms. Due to the inherent principal-agent problem of state-owned firms and soft budget constraint, subsidies can only increase the probability to undertake R{\&}D activities but cannot stimulate further investment in R{\&}D efforts. However, our results indicate that government subsidies take effects in both elements of R{\&}D decision for non-state firms.},

We also estimate for the sample of sub-Saharan Africa and North Africa during the same period. The analysis is extended to food and beverages (FB) only MVA. The analyses point to large differences in sector shares both across countries at different levels of economic development. Using a two-stage least squares (2SLS) regression method, it finds that a large proportion of the cross-country variation in FBT MVA and FB MVA can be accounted for by country characteristics, policy and institutional variables. In particular, the paper finds that an inverted U-shaped relationship with real per capita GDP for FBT MVA and FB MVA, except in FB MVA in North Africa where the reverse is true. Key positive drivers of FBT MVA for the entire continent include government consumption expenditure, household consumption expenditure, social globalization, dependence on oil, minerals, natural gas, coal and forest resources, arable land, and renewable electricity output. Major negative drivers are trade openness and population size. The policy implications and lessons of these results for increasing FBT and FB MVA and feeding Africa are discussed.},

abstract = {After 2005, commodity prices experienced their longest and broadest boom since World War II. Agricultural prices have now come down considerably since their 2011 peak, but are still 40{\%} higher in real terms than their 2000 lows. This paper briefly addresses the main arguments on the causes of the agricultural price cycle. It broadens the scope of analysis by focusing on six agricultural commodities, and identifies the relative weights of key quantifiable drivers of their prices. It concludes that increases in real income negatively affect real agricultural prices, consistent with the Prebisch–Singer hypothesis and its predecessor, Engel's Law. Energy prices matter most (not surprisingly, given the energy-intensive nature of agriculture), followed by stock-to-use ratios and, to a lesser extent, ex-change rate movements. The cost of capital affects prices only marginally, probably because it not only influences demand, but also evokes a supply response. The added value of these results lies in that, when examined in tandem and against market fundamentals, they challenge the conclusions from uni-dimensional approaches that often put disproportionate weight on an individual factor.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Many of the distortions in poorly performing economies do not originate in the banking sector, but where state banks still control a large share of the resources in the banking system, they continue to pose a risk to macroeconomic and fiscal stability. State banks are typically vehicles for patronage that worsen the prospects for competitive market development. Alternatively, these state banks can be ineffective shells that fail to perform a useful intermediation role once the government imposes effective hard budget constraints and a modern supervisory system. The most problematic state banks have been agricultural and industrial banks, whose original role was to finance state farms and industrial enterprises that employed large numbers of people and served as the backbone of the socialist economic mode. Banks now show stronger growth in deposits and capital in many countries in Central and Eastern Europe and the Baltics, suggesting that these countries have put into place structures that have helped to restore confidence in banking systems among creditors, investors, and the public. Recommended strategies are that Governments need to design strategies to reduce state banking in order to help create a stable banking environment. Governments should take measures to improve the business environment as part of a broad overall strategy to strengthen the financial system and end state ownership of banks. Such measures include providing support to improve corporate governance, reform judicial systems, build registries of collateral, reinforce creditors' rights and contract enforcement, modernize accounting and auditing practices, reduce administrative obstacles to business registration, and modernize bankruptcy laws.},

abstract = {This paper provides a detailed analysis of food processing industry in India, its S{\&}T capability, skills and employment opportunities. Food processing industry is slowly and steadily becoming one of the major industries of our economy. Its share in GDP is on continuous rise, with a CAGR of 8.40 per cent, from 2005-06 to 2009-10. TherOe has been a continuous increase in the total plan outlay amount from INR 650 crore in 10th Plan; to INR 15077 crore in proposed outlay for 12th Plan. The sector is growing, but it is yet to compete in the world market. India's share in world export is meagre with 1.17 per cent. There is a wide gap between productivity and processing of items. The factors which have been used to study food processing industry are S{\&}T capability of sector, its employment generation capacity and skills needed in the sector. The S{\&}T capability segment venture into the changing trend of technology, difference between conventional and modern technology, the areas in which India is lagging behind. The employment generation capacity highlights growth and size of the industry and skills about the kind of human resources involved in the industry, the level of technology used in the sector. The employment generation capacity of the sector is huge, but the industry is not working at its potential. The labour force is highly unskilled, with 80 per cent of them having educational level below 10 th standard. The impact of a variety of policies and programmes undertaken by government to develop food processing sector has not been very encouraging. The state needs to strengthen its efforts in S{\&}T capability, infrastructure support and skill set in order to develop food processing industry.},

This study draws on the resource-based view and dynamic capability literature to explore relationships between customer collaboration, diversification and innovation performance of service firms. A conceptual framework was developed and tested using a survey of 156 mining equipment, technology and services (METS) firms in South Australia, and case studies. The findings indicate that service and market diversification mediate the relationship between customer collaboration and innovation performance. Importantly, our findings demonstrate that customer collaboration has no direct effect on the innovation performance of service firms. The research helps practitioners and policymakers to understand the importance of enhancing collaboration across supply chains to build diversified and resilient to downturns in traditional sectors service economies.},

Their analysis allows the identification of those sectors that affect the demand and supply system greatly, therefore constituting the basis for the growth and development of a territory. In order to pinpoint those sectors whose position is more relevant in the economy, a definition of centrality measures is proposed from network theory that is considered to be new in the input-output field. The definition is based on the consideration of three complementary characteristics: Total effects, mediative effects and immediate effects. The term used for these measures is 'multilevel indicators' and these indicators have the enormous advantage of allowing different sized structures to be compared and the key sector concept to be approached from a relational and global viewpoint.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {The chapter examines the role of the agro-processing economy as a crucial engine for structural transformation in Ghana. We first discuss the evolutionary process of policies that have been enacted to promote the activities of the agricultural sector, and how these may have affected the agro-processing sector, given existing linkages. We also provide a discussion of the evolution and structure of agro-processing firms in Ghana, with some emphasis on their performance and constraints. We describe value chain activities of four key agro-processing subsectors in Ghana, in addition to case studies of firms in the fruit and fruit juices and nuts and oils subsectors. We emphasize the potential of the Ghanaian agro-processing industry in contributing to sustained growth and development.},

The model has agricultural and manufacturing sectors. Only agriculture uses land. If at early dates income per capita is low, agricultural consumption is important, land is valuable, and capital gains on land may constitute most wealth accumulation, leaving the country's NIPA APS low. If exogenous technological progress raises incomes over time, Engel's law shifts demand to manufactured goods. Then land's portfolio importance relative to reproducible capital diminishes and the national income and products account saving rate can rise.},

abstract = {This paper examines the effects of local and global shocks on the sector indices and national returns of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) by using the univariate AR-GARCH model. We find that regional and global shocks have different influences on the ASEAN-wide sector and national equity indices. There is evidence that the ASEAN-wide sectoral returns are mostly driven by local shocks, except for the insurance and technology sectors. The volatility of Singapore's and Vietnam's national returns mostly results from their own shocks rather than local and global shocks. Applying the trend spillover model, this paper also shows that the effects of regional and global shocks on return volatility have been decreasing for almost all ASEAN-wide sectors' equity indices, while the trend for the volatility spillover effects of those shocks are positive and significant for the production and industries group sectors, as well as the food and beverage sector. Comparing the variance ratios of ASEAN sectoral and national returns, it is evident that the percentage of national equity returns belonging to their own shocks is higher than that of sectoral returns, indicating that investors might be better off diversifying their assets across countries rather than sectors in ASEAN area. This finding is consistent with the results of the mean-variance frontiers, as the portfolio composed purely of ASEAN national returns has a stronger efficiency frontier than a portfolio of all ASEAN-wide sector equity returns. By using the spanning and intersection tests, the paper also indicates that adding ASEAN national equity returns might improve the efficiency frontiers of investors' holding portfolios. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Malnourishment continues to remain a challenge in developing countries. As the undernourished are largely smallholder farmers, it is widely assumed that farm diversification and mixed crop-livestock agricultural systems can help alleviate this problem. However, empirical evidence in this context is limited. Hence, we use a two-year panel's data from Laos to examine whether farm production diversity as well as a mixed crop-livestock farming system improves household dietary diversity among smallholder farmer. The results from the fixed effects regression indicate that although farm production diversity does lead to a higher dietary diversity, the effect diminishes with continued farm diversification. The counterfactual analysis from the endogenous switching regression reveals that mixed crop-livestock farming systems do not necessarily enhance dietary diversity. However, we further find that purchasing food from the markets plays an important role in enhancing the dietary diversity of rural smallholder farmers.},

We find that credit participants observe a 26.1{\%} increase in paddy income, 68.9{\%} in paddy quantity and 26.5{\%} in expenditure on inputs of paddy production. Poorer households benefit more from credit participation. Participants also observe an increased non-land durable assets relative to those of non-participants, particularly agricultural assets. We find week evidence that women participants benefit more from credit programme than male counterparts. Although women are more likely to start self-employment activities with the loans—mainly in informal sector—the income gains are not statistically different from zero relative to what men earn.},

abstract = {Food safety standards are a necessity to protect consumers' health in today's growing global food trade. A number of studies have suggested safety standards can interrupt trade, bringing financial and technical burdens on small as well as large agri-food producers in developing countries. Other examples have shown that economical extension, key intermediaries, and funded initiatives have substantially enhanced the capacities of growers in some countries of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region to meet the food safety and quality requirements, and improve their access to international markets. These endeavors often compensate for the weak regulatory framework, but do not offer a sustainable solution. There is a big gap in the food safety level and control systems between countries in the MENA region and those in the developed nations. This certainly has implications for the safety of fresh produce and agricultural practices, which hinders any progress in their international food trade. To overcome the barriers of legal and private standards, food safety should be a national priority for sustainable agricultural development in the MENA countries. Local governments have a primary role in adopting the vision for developing and facilitating the implementation of their national Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) standards that are consistent with the international requirements and adapted to local policies and environment. Together, the public and private sector's support are instrumental to deliver the skills and infrastructure needed for leveraging the safety and quality level of the agri-food chain.},

This paper establishes a new research framework for density of enterprise output value and wages conditional on loans to balance economic benefit (sales revenue) and social responsibility (employee payroll). Using data on 9125 Chinese enterprises from January 2015 to December 2017, this paper shows that loans have a range effect on sales revenue and employee payroll, which ascends gradually to a plateau and eventually descends. Based on this finding, this paper proposes a reallocation scheme. With total loans unchanged, fixed sales revenue can increase employee payroll by 3.8{\%}. Similarly, fixed employee payroll can increase sales revenue by 5.2{\%}. This study not only provides empirical evidence for financially supporting MSEs, but also provides alternative decision support for policy design.},

While extensive research has focussed on the role of customer collaboration in service firm innovation performance, fewer studies have examined the role of firm diversification in this relationship. This study draws on the resource-based view and dynamic capability literature to explore relationships between customer collaboration, diversification and innovation performance of service firms. A conceptual framework was developed and tested using a survey of 156 mining equipment, technology and services (METS) firms in South Australia, and case studies. The findings indicate that service and market diversification mediate the relationship between customer collaboration and innovation performance. Importantly, our findings demonstrate that customer collaboration has no direct effect on the innovation performance of service firms. The research helps practitioners and policymakers to understand the importance of enhancing collaboration across supply chains to build diversified and resilient to downturns in traditional sectors service economies.},

This examination of the literature suggests four main directions in which future research on regional economic diversity could go. First, it is shown that research on the relationship between economic diversity and regional income distribution is scarce yet critical. Second, recent research suggests that applications of input-output analysis hold the potential for integrative research on issues related to economic diversity. Third, an examination of the local economic development literature indicates that regional scientists could use the concept of "diversified specializations" to classify economic regions and evaluate clusters. Fourth, the literature on ecological diversity suggests additional ways to look at the issue of economic diversity-stability.},

abstract = {The diversification-performance literature emphasizes the application of quantitative diversification measures and the need for a unified theory of diversification. There has been little discussion, however, regarding the appropriateness of generalizing results found in the manufacturing sector to other economic sectors. This study suggests that differences in theory development, data collection and analysis between economic sectors raise serious concerns regarding the development of a unified theory of diversification. To demonstrate the point, this study applies the entropy method to manufacturing, wholesaling and retailing. The propensity of firms to pursue various diversification strategies and the effects of diversification on performance are examined. CR - Copyright {\&}{\#}169; 1998 M.E. Sharpe, Inc.},

The models generally allow us to trace the intersectoral and intertemporal growth effects of these policies as well as their income distribution effects across social groups. The results obtained are shown to be eventually quite different from those derived from partial equilibrium and multimarket approaches. Sensitivity analysis to alternative specifications of the mechanism of wage determination shows that the real income effects of price policies are critically dependent upon the particular theory of wage determination used.},

Through a large-scale empirical survey of more than 1000 Chinese manufacturing firms, the empirical evidences show that whereas the major government financial incentives such as Special Loans and Tax Credits were positively influential to innovative economic performance of firms, Direct Earmarks not only failed to enhance innovative economic performance, it sometimes negatively affected it. Surprisingly, the findings show that all financial incentives of governments were unrelated to the patents of either high-tech or general firms and Direct Earmarks affected the patents of these firms negatively, although not to a significant degree. This indicates that the centrally planned funding system of the 1990s was ineffective for enhancing technological progress for Chinese manufacturing firms. The study results imply that the Chinese government should further increase the role of market force in its reforms. A more market-driven model by developing more S{\&}T initiatives to match the strategic directions of different enterprises, particularly SOEs, is recommended.},

Increasing demand for high-quality food with pioneering texture profiles, consumer needs for personalised products impacting product formulation (i.e., fat, sugar and micronutrient content), and constrained availability of ingredients and resources are pressuring industrialists to utilise alternative technologies to enable a more sustainable food supply. Distributed and localised food manufacturing (DLM) has been identified as a promising strategy towards future sustainable systems with technology representing one of its cornerstones. Innovative methods and tools to support the selection of the best alternative technologies for DLM are required. This paper provides an overview of food processing technologies and includes a novel classification created to support future assessments. A novel qualitative assessment method encompassing multiple criteria to understand specific food technologies suitability for future DLM systems is presented. Finally, research benefits are explored through the application of the assessment method to several selected technologies with promising potential in future food manufacturing. The results demonstrate that this methodological approach can assist in the adoption of DLM food systems through the selection of the best technologies integrating individual manufacturer requirements.},

It will be argued that both the state and the corporate sector have a role to play in providing the means with which vulnerable consumers can overcome financial exclusion, through access to fair services. However, this cannot and should not be achieved through increased welfare provision or through reliance on corporate social responsibility initiatives alone. In rejecting solutions focused on increased welfare or voluntary corporate social responsibility initiatives, this article suggests that regulatory support for the development and growth of social enterprises, such as community development finance institutions, will most effectively give rise to a social framework in which vulnerability and unequal opportunity with respect to financial services is addressed. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {Many developing countries facing fluctuating export earnings frequently embark on ambitious diversification programs aimed at reducing the concentration of their commodity offering. For most, however, the limited value of a strategy consisting of merely increasing the number of commodities exported soon becomes apparent. This study examines the potential for applying portfolio theory to select the agricultural commodities to be exported by a developing country when farmer prices are set and guaranteed by a marketing board. The major portfolio diversification problems encountered are discussed and suggestions are made regarding their solution. {\textcopyright} 1993 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

Then we estimated a quantile regression model to assess the impact of the intensity of adoption of direct marketing strategies on gross cash farm income.

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

We distinguish between default risk (likelihood of creditors' losses) and operating risk (likelihood of negative equity). Our analysis is based on the joint use of issuer ratings, a synthetic measure of a bank's probability of default, and individual ratings, which omit the influence of any external support and focus on a bank's operating risk. We report two main results. First, government-owned banks (GOBs) have lower default risk but higher operating risk than private banks, indicating the presence of governmental protection that induces higher risk taking. Second, GOBs' operating risk and governmental protection tend to increase in election years. These results are consistent with the idea that GOBs pursue political goals and have important policy implications for recently nationalized European banks. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

However, the efforts to push grain production everywhere have resulted in not only deterioration of the environment but also stagnation or even reduction in farmers' income as production costs continue to increase. This situation might be worsening after China's accession to the WTO that provides market access for bulk commodity imports. A sustainable development in Chinese agriculture depends on diversification, or structural adjustment, that allows Chinese farmers to fully utilize their comparative advantage in production of labor-intensive goods. Past experience has shown that diversification has contributed more than a half of the growth in Chinese agriculture during the reform period and reduced stresses on the environment at the same time. It is likely to contribute even more to Chinese agriculture in the future and in a sustainable manner. {\textcopyright} 2004 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {This article contributes to the existing empirical literature by examining the spillovers across price inflation and agricultural commodity prices for the case of Nigeria. To achieve this objective, we employ the Diebold and Yilmaz (Int J Forecast 28(1):57–66, 2012) spillover index. Subsequently, we examine the directional spillover, total spillover, and net spillover indexes. Further analysis to capture cyclical and secular movements was addressed with 40 months of subsamples via the rolling window analysis. Our empirical results, based on the monthly frequency data from January 2006 to July 2016 show that the total spillover effect was about 75{\%}. This suggests a high interconnectedness of the selected agricultural commodity prices and inflation. Further empirical findings shows that inflation, sorghum, soybeans, and wheat were net receivers while cocoa, barley, groundnut, maize, rice were net givers. We find a negative net spillover for price inflation, implying a net positive spillover from commodity prices to price inflation. Based on these outcomes, several inherent policy implications for the government administrators, farmers, investors and all stakeholders abound. For instance, the need for government officials to insulate the agricultural market from externalities for optimum prices stability is pertinent.},

Yet, international-conglomerate shows a significant negative relationship with performance. Meanwhile, the efficiency results are contrary to our conjecture. We find that efficiency is a factor to enhance performance, but it is not the moderating variable on the diversification-performance link.

Using firm-level data for a sample of Portuguese manufacturing firms over the 2006–2013 period, we investigate how public financial support at the firm level is related to observable firm's characteristics. Our findings suggest that firms lacking resources, capabilities and international involvement seem to be those with great barriers to use public financial support. Therefore, it cast doubts on the efficiency of public financial support programmes aiming to mitigate market failures, by assisting constrained firms. In turn, public financial support seems to boost market selection mechanisms by favouring ‘good' firms and pushing less-endowed firms outside the market.},

The authors use two alternative panel data sets and fixed effects models to estimate the causal effect of credit supply (with lagged explanatory variables) on agricultural GDP growth per rural resident. Findings – The authors find a positive association between agricultural lending and agricultural GDP growth per rural resident with additional billion in loans (about a third of the actual average) associated with 7-10 percent higher state growth rate with this association stronger during the 1990s. Regional data confirm these results. The results point to a positive link between credit and economic growth in rural areas during that period, attributable to the lending by FCS institutions and by commercial banks. Research limitations/implications – Data availability limits the scope of this paper. The authors use state level balance sheet data available for the 1991-2003 period and annual data for 2003-2010 period. An additional regional data set is constructed for 1991-2010 withmore aggregated data for the ten USDA agricultural production regions. The small number of panels limits the ability to use more sophisticated econometric models and the choice of dependent variables that captures economic growth. Practical implications – By provides evidence that agricultural finance and in particular lending contribute significantly to the growth of US agriculture, this paper contributes to the policy debate on weather support for agricultural finance initiatives is justified. Originality/value – The authors are not aware of another study that has linked agricultural lending by commercial banks and FCS institutions to growth in rural areas in the USA.},

abstract = {Sustainable development is an eternal topic in the development of human society. The paper seeks to contribute to the adoption of sustainable development practices in the food processing enterprises of China by fostering the capacities of the enterprises. Moreover, the paper aims to contribute to the promotion of sustainable consumption by helping and encouraging consumers in making informed choices of sustainable and eco-efficient produced foodstuffs. We combined with 1015 survey data in 28 areas of China by using AHP model analysis of the sustainable development of food processing enterprises. The results show that, the overall level of sustainable development ability of food processing enterprises in China is not high; paying attention to economic is significantly more important than paying attention to social and environmental aspects. Chinese food processing entities have an acceptable basis for the implementation of sustainable development. But there are still some problems. Finally, some suggestions are put forward to promote the sustainable development of Chinese food processing enterprises.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Non-state owned firms in China grow tremendously with limited support from banks. This provides a unique setting to test how firms in a country with poorly developed financial institutions fund their prosperous growth opportunities. This paper compares the use of an important non-formal financial channel, trade credit, between state and non-state owned firms in China. We find that, compared to state owned firms, non-state owned firms use more trade credit. We further show that this higher usage is primarily for financing rather than transactional purposes. The results suggest that, in a country with a poorly developed formal financial sector, firms can support their growth through non-formal financial channels that largely rely on implicit contractual relation. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Firms that maintain such exclusive relationships have an investment cash flow sensitivity that is almost 30{\%} lower relative to other firms. GOB relationships also increase sensitivity of investment to Tobin's Q. Exclusive relationships with private banks increase cash flow sensitivity while exclusive relationships with foreign banks have no impact. The lower investment cash flow sensitivity by firms with exclusive GOB relationships is not the result of cherry picking of less constrained firms by GOBs. Rather, firms with exclusive GOB relationships are in worse financial condition relative to other firms – thus, GOBs appear to be doing reverse of cherry picking. Surprisingly, the results are driven by the large firms which benefit from GOB relationship and not the smaller firms which are the intended beneficiaries of government directed credit programs.},

State-owned banks charge lower interest rates than do privately owned banks to similar or identical firms, even if firms are able to borrow more from privately owned banks. State-owned banks mostly favor large firms and firms located in depressed areas. The lending behavior of state-owned banks is affected by the electoral results of the party affiliated with the bank: the stronger the political party in the area where the firm is borrowing, the lower the interest rates charged. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

@techreport{Sam2019,
abstract = {This article analyzes the factors that drive the gender income difference among farmers in Cambodia with a focus on the access to formal credit, using the FinScope survey data. First, an Ordinary Least Square regression (OLS) is used to investigate the main determinants of farmers' income, while an instrumental variable approach (IV) is estimated to check the causal effect of the access to formal credit on earnings. Next, the Blinder-Oaxaca technique is employed to decompose the gender earnings gap. Results from OLS regression show that individual education and health, farm size and other inputs, irrigation system and weather conditions, access to market and formal credit are strongly associated with farmers' earnings, while the positive impact of access to formal credit is also confirmed by the IV regression at 5{\%} significant level. These results suggest that improving infrastructure and formal credit access in the rural areas play a critical role in increasing farmers' income. Then, based on the Blinder- Oaxaca decomposition technique, most of gender earnings difference is due to the endowment effect in favor of male farmers such as education, farm size and volume of work hours. Access to formal credit also contributes to the gender earnings gap, yet not in terms of endowment but coefficient effect, as a higher return to credit access for male farmers is observed. This could be due to the levels of education and financial literacy that are higher for men, allowing them to use the formal credit better. Closing the gap in education and financial literacy would therefore reduce their earnings gap. Discrimination against female farmers, not in terms of credit access, but in loan amount should be worth to consider as well, as the median of loan amounts of male farmers is higher than those of female. If such discrimination exists, it could also limit the women's capacity to manage and invest in their farms effectively, and thus, the return to credit access must be lower for female farmers.},

Unlike the ‘traditional' generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) family models, GARCH-MIDAS component model can capture the time-varying conditional as well as unconditional volatilities, and accommodates macroeconomic variables observed at different frequencies through mixed interval data sampling (MIDAS) specification. The results of our specification tests revealed the existence of both time-varying conditional and unconditional variance. The fitted GARCH-MIDAS component models showed that realized volatility, inflation rate and fuel oil price have had an increasing effect on the price volatility of the commodities under consideration, while real effective exchange rate (REER) had the opposite effect. Furthermore, mean square error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and Diebold and Mariano (DM) test were used for evaluating and comparing the forecasting ability of GARCH-MIDAS component models against standard GARCH models. The results revealed that GARCH-MIDAS component models outperformed the standard GARCH model for high-frequency data.},

abstract = {Because of the high volatility of prices of agricultural commodities over the past decade, the importance of accurate price forecasting for decision makers has become even more acute. This paper reviews literature on forecasting and evaluation. An application with forecasting U.S. hog prices is presented which includes both economic and statistical evaluation measures. Seven forecasting approaches are described and their performances are examined over 24 quarters from 1976 to 1981. These methods include exponential smoothing, an autoregressive integrated moving average process, an econometric model, expert judgement, and a composite forecasting approach. The application gives results which support previous findings in the forecasting literature and suggests that forecasting methods can provide valuable information to the decision maker.

The goal of the present paper is to quantify the macro-level consequences of these micro-level shocks. Using an extremely rich micro-level data set that contains information about the productivity—both before and after climate change—of each of 10 crops for each of 1.7 million fields covering the surface of the earth, we find that the impact of climate change on these agricultural markets would amount to a 0.26 percent reduction in global GDP when trade and production patterns are allowed to adjust. Since the value of output in our 10 crops is equal to 1.8 percent of world GDP, this corresponds to about one-sixth of total crop value.},

We use more representative subsidy indicators and a wider coverage (panel data from 213 EU regions over the period 2004–2014) than have been used before. We find that, on average, EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) subsidies increase agricultural labor productivity growth, but this aggregate effect hides important heterogeneity of effects of different types of subsidies. The positive effect on productivity comes from decoupled subsidies, that is, Pillar I decoupled payments and some Pillar II payments. Coupled Pillar I subsidies have the opposite effect: they slow down productivity growth.},

abstract = {The implementation of wide-ranging policy reforms, including trade and exchange rate policies, is improving the efficiency of the South African economy and its reintegration into the global economy with rapid export expansion. Agricultural exports in the Southern African Customs Union increased from R8.14 billion in 1995 to R23.0 billion in 2003, whilst agricultural imports rose from R6.83 billion to R13.84 billion during the same period. This article uses alternative approaches to forecasting agricultural exports and imports in South Africa. The models used include: exponential smoothing, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), vector autoregression (VAR), Engle-Granger (EG) single-equation and vector error-correction models (VECM). We found that the ARIMA and EG methods outperform the VAR and VECM according to Theil's U-statistic. The VAR outperforms the VECM in forecasting agricultural exports in South Africa. The combined forecasts have a lower variance compared to individual forecasts, thereby, reducing the risks of making wrong decisions based on the forecasts. The article provides empirical evidence that is beneficial to policymakers and business leaders in South Africa as they strive to reduce poverty and inequality and increase economic growth.},

This paper argues that a possible reason why some studies may conclude that aid is ineffective in promoting economic growth might be that not all aid is given for development purposes (i.e. aid given for strategic considerations, humanitarian reasons or emergency relief). This study classifies foreign aid into four subcategories: agricultural aid, social infrastructure aid, investment aid, and non-investment aid. Using the generalized method of moments (GMM) estimation technique on a Barro type growth regression with panel data from the aid recipient economies, this paper finds that when aid is directed to the agricultural sector of the developing countries, it is positively and significantly related to growth and can affect economic growth in the short run. {\textcopyright} 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Sector funds' self-imposed limits on diversification have both costs and benefits. Sector funds tend to perform as well as other equity funds, but their performance tends to be sensitive to the benchmark that is used. In addition, sector-fund managers do not exhibit any significant persistence in performance. Although sector funds tend to be moderately less diversified than other equity funds, they do not entail greater systematic risk. Sector funds exhibit larger total risk than the control sample, but they are not any riskier than small-cap and aggressive-growth funds. Factor analysis results provide evidence that variation in sector-fund returns can be attributed to two common underlying factors, and the primary factor appears to be the return on the market index.},

abstract = {While the history and methodology of laboratory experiments in economics have been extensively studied by philosophers, those of field experiments have not attracted much attention until recently. What is the historical context in which field experiments have been advocated? And what are the methodological rationales for conducting experiments in the field as opposed to in the lab? This article addresses these questions by combining historical and methodological perspectives. In terms of history, we show that the movement toward field experiments in economics has two distinct roots. One is the general orientation of medical and social sciences to evidence-based policy evaluation, which gave rise to randomized field experiments in economics (e.g., behavioral public policy, poverty alleviation policy). The other is an awareness of several methodological limitations of lab experiments in economics, which required practitioners to get out of the lab and into the field. In these senses, the movement is a consequence of influences from both outside and inside economics: the general evidence-based trend in policy science and an internal methodological development of experimental economics. In terms of methodology, we show that these two roots resulted in two somewhat different notions of “external validity” as methodological rationales of field experiment. Finally, we suggest that analysis of experiments as exhibits highlights a methodological strategy in which both strands complement each other.},

By integrating the literature on financial slack and the institutional perspective, we predict the following: financial slack positively affects the firm performance of SMMEs; research and development (R{\&}D) investment mediates the effect of financial slack on firm performance; and government subsidies and market-supporting institutions positively moderate this mediating effect. Using 543 firms' 4489 firm-year observations of Chinese SMMEs, the empirical results indicate that financial slack promotes firm performance. In addition, R{\&}D investment partially mediates the relationship between financial slack and firm performance. Moreover, the relationship between financial slack and R{\&}D investment is weakened in high levels of government subsidies, and the relationship between R{\&}D investment and firm performance is strengthened in high levels of government subsidies and market-supporting institutions. Theoretical contributions, practical implications, limitations, and future research avenues are discussed.},

We use the technological development assistance funds as a proxy for governmental support policies for SMEs in the regional industries in Korea. The innovation of SMEs is measured by technological innovation: patent, utility model, trademark, and new design registrations. Before empirically testing the impact of governmental support policies on the innovation of SMEs, this study reviews the literature concerning the innovation and the governmental support policies of SMEs in regional industries. Results from empirical models, which simultaneously control for factors which were thought to affect the innovation of regional SMEs, indicate that a positive relationship exists among the technological development assistance by the Korean government and patent acquisitions and new design registrations of regional SMEs. Networks with universities also have a positive relationship with patent acquisitions and new design registrations of regional SMEs. This study suggests there is an importance to governmental financial aids for regional SME innovations, and there is an importance to the need to build a strong social relationship in today's networked economy. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

The empirical economic literature has identified several stylized facts about the pattern of diversification of economies, but the development of explanations for those patterns, in general, has been only loosely associated with an economic theory on growth, trade, technology change and structural transformation. Making that connection is relevant because it could inform policymakers in developing countries in designing and implementing policies for promoting diversification.

abstract = {This study investigates the dynamic relationship between diversification, capital structure and profitability. Previous empirical studies have not considered the dynamics of this relationship, the endogeneity problem and causality factors. To overcome these econometric problems simultaneously, I build a panel vector autoregression model (PVAR) for 412 French financial institutions over ten years. There is some evidence of reverse causality between these variables after controlling the individual fixed effects. Moreover, there are an inverse bidirectional causal relation of profitability with leverage and diversification. The condition of stability is not confirmed for the relationship between diversification and leverage, but it is proved for the three factors observed simultaneously. The forecast error variance decompositions confirm the choice of the diversification as the most endogenous variable. Impulse response functions illustrate significant dynamic interrelationships in the financial sector. Our findings are robust across several measures of activity and geographic diversification (Entropy and Herfindahl-Hirschman index).},

abstract = {The purpose of the paper is scientific grounding of theoretical and methodological approaches to the fun- damental principles of the functioning of the existing system of financial support of the agrarian sector in Ukraine and its potential areas of its improvement through the construction of new effective financing mechanisms. Methodology. In the study the following methods are used: a comparative and morphological methods – to reveal the content and development of scientific thoughts about the interpretation of the concept of «financial support»; methods of systematization and generalization – to determine the functionality of the agricultural sector and the need of its financial support and to reveal the features of its functioning; systemic method – to construct a model of the implementation of agricultural sector financial support; logical method – for a consistent generalization of theoretical and practical scientific research statements. Results. Investigation of formation and development of the doctrine of financial support and systematization of scientific thoughts about its essence gives the opportunity to consider the content of the studied category in terms of the functional approach. Interpretation of the term “finan- cial support” comes down to the statement that the formation of the theoretical foundations of the essence and the economic nature of financial support is a result of the achievements of several generations of scientists, each of whom invested a significant contribution to the development of the theory of the studied concept. This allowed us to analyze the term «financial providing» and to summarize the existing approaches in the light of the activities of the agricultural sector. In terms of functionality we found that financial support as a phenomenon can be seen in the context of its unique significance in the development of the economy. Practical implications. It was determined that the problems of financial support of the agricultural sector in Ukraine have a complex nature and relate to the economic, social and political spheres of its operation. The most important obstacles in the financial and credit sphere were and remain as follows: lack of adequate financial infrastructure to facilitate its development; lack of property that can be taken as sufficiently liquid collateral to guarantee repayment of the loan; complicated proce- dure for obtaining a bank loan and the length of the decision-making on the provision of concessional loans; lack of common rules for access of entities to the sources of financial resources; systematic need for funds for working capital; need for financial resources for the operation etc. In the article it is concretized and enhanced the concept of «financial security» as a system, which is characterized by a set of elements (tools, forms, methods of financing, leverages of the financial impact) and the relationship between them, the proper organization of which should focus on the effective development of the agricultural sector, and the fulfillment of its functions and the ability to show the closeness of the relationship between all the structural elements of the system in the process providing of agrarian business by financial resources. Value/originality. Such interpretation of the essence of «financial support» allows making justification of funds of financial support of the agricultural sector of Ukraine.},

abstract = {We quantitatively assess the impacts of re-allocating budgetary resources within Pillar 1 of the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) from direct income support to a direct greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction subsidy for EU farmers. The analysis is motivated by the discussion on the future CAP, with calls for both an increased ambition on climate action from the agricultural sector and for a more incentive-based delivery system of direct payments under strict budgetary restrictions. By conducting a simulation experiment with an agricultural partial equilibrium model (CAPRI), we are able to factor in farmers' supply and technology-adjusting responses to the policy change and to estimate the potential uptake of the GHG-reduction subsidy in EU regions. We find that a budget-neutral re-allocation of financial resources towards subsidised emission savings can reduce EU agricultural non-CO2 emissions by 21{\%} by 2030, compared to a business-as-usual baseline. Two-thirds of the emission savings are due to changes in production levels and composition, implying that a significant part of the achieved GHG reduction is offset globally by emission leakage. At the aggregated level, the emission-saving subsidy and increased producer prices compensate farmers for the foregone direct income support, but differences in regional impacts indicate accelerated structural change and heterogeneous income effects in the farm population. We conclude that the assumed regional budget-neutrality condition introduces inefficiencies in the incentive system, and the full potential of the EU farming sector for GHG emissions reduction is not reached, leaving ample room for the design of more efficient agricultural policies for climate action.},
